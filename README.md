# Hay Forever

A mod for [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) that makes hay last longer while also ensuring it doesn't deterioate when left outside. It seemed to me that hay should be able to be exposed to the weather while not instantly deterating.

**Requires RimWorld: 1.0.2059**

## Modifications

* `daysToRotStart` increased from `15` to `120`
* `DeteriorationRate` set to `0`
